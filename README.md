# The One Sixth Guide

## Objective

I was tasked with developing a four-page website to showcase the skills and knowledge I gained during my Internet and Web Development program.  The goal was to create a resource for newcomers to the 1/6th scale collectible community – a one-stop guide where enthusiasts could fine curated information, tips, and examples to help them navigate the hobby.

## Synopsis

The website is inspired by the early days of blog websites from the 2000s.  It references other websites, merchants, and YouTube videos that are relevant to the 1/6th scale collectible community.  The motivation behind this project came from noticing a lack of curated resources for hobbyists.  I wanted to create the kind of website I wished had existed when I first entered the community.

## Process

I used Visual Studio Code as the primary software for the HTML and CSS coding.  Adobe Photoshop was used to edit the photos I took with my iPhone.  To provide a practical example for the audience, I purchased a 1/6th scale Captain America figure from Hot Toys for a customization demonstration on one of the pages.  I also gathered helpful resources for visitors, aiming to provide guidance and knowledge that would enhance their experience in the 1/6th scale hobby.

## Results

The assignment was completed on time with a budget of $220.  Visitors now have access to curated resources covering all aspects of 1/6th scale collectibles, from figure customization to community insights.  The website can be explored in full at the following link:

#### Additional Remarks

I plan to revise this project over the course of the next year. I’d like to change the color scheme, though I haven’t decided on a better one yet. I also plan to make monthly updates to the website, especially as new third-party sellers continue to scam members of the community. Additionally, I’d love to add a comments section to each page so audiences can share their input and point out anything I might have originally missed.
